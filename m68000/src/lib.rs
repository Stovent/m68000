//! Motorola 68000 interpreter, disassembler and assembler (code emitter).
//!
//! This library emulates the common user and supervisor instructions of the M68k ISA.
//! It is configurable to behave like the given CPU type (see below), changing the instruction's execution times and exception handling.
//!
//! This library has been designed to be used in two different contexts:
//!
//! - It can be used to emulate a whole CPU, and the user of this library only have to call the interpreter methods
//! and [M68000::exception] when an interrupt or reset occurs. This is usually the case in an emulator.
//! - It can also be used as a M68k user-land interpreter to run an M68k program, but without the requirement of having an
//! operating system compiled to binary M68k. In this case, the application runs the program until an exception occurs (TRAP for
//! syscalls, zero divide, etc.) and treat the exception in Rust code (or any other language using the C interface), so the
//! application can implement the surrounding environment required by the M68k program in a high level language and not in M68k assembly.
//!
//! # Supported CPUs
//!
//! The CPU type is specified with a generic parameter on the main structure.
//! The trait `CpuDetails` contains all the details of the emulated CPU:
//! - Instruction execution times
//! - Exception processing times
//! - Exception stack format
//!
//! m68000 provides CPU details for the following CPUs:
//! * MC68000 (as described in the M68000 8-/16-/32-Bit Microprocessors Userâ€™s Manual, Ninth Edition)
//! * SCC68070 microcontroller
//!
//! # How to use
//!
//! m68000 requires a nightly compiler as it uses the `btree_drain_filter` feature of the std.
//!
//! First, since the memory map is application-dependant, it is the user's responsibility to define it by implementing
//! the `MemoryAccess` trait on their memory structure, and passing it to the core on each instruction execution.
//!
//! Second, choose the CPU behavior by specifying the instance that implements the `CpuDetails` trait,
//! whether it is your own or one the provided ones.
//!
//! The file `src/bin/scc68070.rs` is a usage example that implements the SCC68070 microcontroller.
//!
//! ## Basic usage:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! const MEM_SIZE: u32 = 65536;
//! struct Memory([u8; MEM_SIZE as usize]); // Define your memory management system.
//!
//! impl MemoryAccess for Memory { // Implement the MemoryAccess trait.
//!     fn get_byte(&mut self, addr: u32) -> Option<u8> {
//!         if addr < MEM_SIZE {
//!             Some(self.0[addr as usize])
//!         } else {
//!             None
//!         }
//!     }
//!
//!     // And so on...
//! }
//!
//! fn main() {
//!     let mut memory = Memory([0; MEM_SIZE as usize]);
//!     // Load the program in memory here.
//!     let mut cpu: M68000<m68000::cpu_details::Mc68000> = M68000::new();
//!
//!     // Execute instructions
//!     cpu.interpreter(&mut memory);
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ## FFI and C interface
//!
//! By enabling the `ffi` feature, the following structs are made `repr(C)`:
//! - [Registers]
//! - [StatusRegister]
//! - [Vector]
//!
//! The crate `m68000-ffi` in the repo is a collection of structures and functions that allows using m68000's
//! interpreter and disassembler in other languages through a C interface.
//!
//! ## TODO:
//! - Let memory access return extra read or write cycles for accuracy.
//! - Verify ABCD, NBCD, SBCD, DIVS and DIVU instructions.
//! - Implement long exception stack frame.
